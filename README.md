    boomcatch = require('boomcatch');

boomcatch.listen({

});

### Data mappers

Mappers are used
to transform data
into appropriate formats
for back-end stats consumers.
Currently, one mapper is available out-of-the-box,
which formats the metrics
as [statsd] timers.

Defining a custom data mapper
is straightforward.
The [source code for the statsd mapper][mapper]
should be easy to follow,
but the basic pattern
is to export an interface
that looks like this:

```javscript
{
    initialise: function (options) {
    },
    separator: '\n'
}
```

The `initialise` function
should return a function
that is passed a data object
and a referring URL
as parameters,
and returns the mapped data
as its result.
The optional separator property
should be a string
that can be used by the UDP forwarder
to ensure that,
if data must be split
into multiple packets,
it can be done at suitable points in the data.

If you then specify
the path to your new mapper
with the `mapper` option,
a first attempt to load it
is made relative
to this project's `src/mappers` directory.
When that call to `require` fails,
a second attempt will be made
using the path that you specified verbatim.

### Data forwarders

Forwarders are used
to send mapped data
to back-end stats consumers.
At the moment, two forwarders are implemented,
dispatching the data over UDP or HTTP.

Defining a custom forwarder
is similar to
[defining a custom mapper](#data-mappers)
and can be seen
in the [source code for the udp forwarder][forwarder].
The module should export
an interface that looks like this:

```javscript
{
    initialise: function (options) {
    }
}
```

In this case,
the `initialise` function
should return a function
that is passed
the mapped data,
an optional data-chunking separator
and a callback function
as its three parameters.
When the forwarding process has completed,
the callback function should be invoked,
following the node.js convention
of the first argument containing any error,
or a falsey value if things went okay.
The second argument should contain
the number of bytes that were sent.

Once your custom forwarder is ready,
you can specify the path to it
using the `forwarder` option.

### Request validators

Validators are used
to test whether each request
should be accepted or rejected.
Typically, they check
for the presence
of a valid nonce
in the query string,
as a preventative measure
against denial-of-service attacks.
One validator is available out-of-the-box,
which simply accepts all requests.

As with mappers and forwarders,
defining your own validator is easy
and the basic interface
looks the same:

```javscript
{
    initialise: function (options) {
    }
}
```

Here,
the `initialise` function
should return a function
that receives an object
representing the parsed query string
and returns either `true` or `false`,
signifying that the request
is valid or invalid respectively.

Requests that are identified as invalid
will fail with an HTTP 400 status.
