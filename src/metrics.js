// There are three categories of metric: boomerang, navtiming and
// restiming.
//
//     * boomerang: data recorded by boomerang.
//     * navtiming: data extracted from the W3C Navigation Timing API.
//     * restiming: data extracted from the W3C Resource Timing API.
//
// Within each category, there are three types of metric: timestamps,
// durations and events.
//
//     * timestamps: milliseconds since the epoch.
//     * durations: milliseconds difference between start timestamp
//                  and some event
//     * events: object with `start` and `end` timestamp properties.
